The Project
===

What's it good for?
	* Use as the localization interface for AMIS, Obi, Tobi, Pipeline
	* Use Obi to record prompts
	* Use XUK format to maintain a template for the help file
	* Put MP3 upload on the website
	* Import/Export routines communicate between the database and the app's XML file (e.g. amisAccessibleUi.xml)

Options:
	* host with us
	* host yourself and install a module on your server (similar to wordpress)

Administrative tasks:
	* add a new user
	* import a new master (English) and review the potential changes
	* get files from export for distribution
	* review user activity
	* merge translated/recorded UI items into a DAISY book template so that the whole book doesn't have to be re-recorded
	
User tasks:
	* enter a text translation
 	* change text
 	* upload small audio files
 	* download an Obi project to do your recording all at once
 	* Upload your Obi project to import the new recordings into the system
